# mc.js
Minecraft, but lightweight and available in your browser!

This project is currently ongoing and part of an effort to create a browser version of Minecraft. At the moment, I have just started a few days ago with this project and thought that it would be a good idea to put this on GitHub so that either I or anyone else with the same goals as me could have it readily available. Right now, it is admittedly very slow, but changes (as you can see below) are coming soon!

**Current Features:**

WASD, Space and Shift to control camera

Proper face culling (at least within chunks)

Flat terrain of grass blocks


**Upcoming Features:**

More efficient terrain generation algorithm

Instancing

More efficient culling algorithm

Skybox

Procedurally-generated terrain
